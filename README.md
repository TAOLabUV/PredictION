# PredictION
A predictive model to establish performance of Oxford sequencing reads of SARS-CoV-2

With PredictION you may estimate sequence reads given a priori known concentration of cDNA (ng/µl) per sample and the desired coverage depth (mean) and coverage per genome (percentage)

A demo of PredictION is available <https://genomicdashboard.herokuapp.com/>
